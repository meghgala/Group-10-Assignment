## Feature:Randomness - Throwing virtual dice (Akanksha)
There are several functions for generating pseudo-random numbers in therandommodule  from  the  standard  library.
For this task,  the user will be asked for a number of six-sided diceto throw.  The results of throwing those dice should be simulated using the random module  and  then  the  results  of  those  (virtual)  throws  should  beprinted, as well as the average.

## Feature: Collatz Sequence (Sagar)
The collatz sequence is a conjecture in mathematics that follows a particular sequence. The sequence is defined as follows: 
1. The sequence begins with any positive integer, say n
2. If the integer n is odd, the next number in sequence would be 3n+1
3. If the integer n is even, the next number in sequence would be n/2
4. The sequence will continue until digit 1 is encountered.

The following function prints the sequence starting from the input given by the user. 

## Feature: Factorial (Megh)
Factorial is the product of all positive integeres upto that particular number.
